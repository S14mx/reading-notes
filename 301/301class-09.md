# Functional Programming Concepts

*What is functional programming?*

It is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

*What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?*

A function which always produces/returns same result(output) if same arguments(input) are passed to it and it only depends on input arguments.

*What are the benefits of a pure function?*

The code is easier to test and there's no need to mock anything.

*What is immutability?*

Innability to be changed after creation.

*What is Referential transparency?*

It's when a function consistently yields the same result with the same input. This means that the program's behavior is not changed whether the input used is a reference or an actual value that the reference is pointing to.

# Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and `require()`

*What is a module?*

It's a bit of code with certain functionality that sits in a separate file that has been split and then called upon whenever it's needed

*What does the word ‘require’ do?*

It basically imports a module so it can be used in the file.

*How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

With `require()` statement.

*What do we have to do to make a module available?*

Export it in the module file with `module.export`.
