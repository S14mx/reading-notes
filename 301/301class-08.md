It's a URI that identifies the resource `https://codefellows.org`  

*What are the most common HTTP verbs?*

GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

*What should the URIs be based on?*

On a hierarchy

**Give an example of a good URI.*  

`/customers/5/orders`

*What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?*  

It means that the API has a large number of small resources and requires multiple requests to find data which is not a good thing because the more requests the bigger the load on the server.
