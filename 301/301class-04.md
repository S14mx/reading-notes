## React Docs - Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

It's a React component that controls the values of input elements in a form using `setState()`.

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

It depends on what we want to achieve. If we update the state as soon as it changes then we will be changing with every key stroke, there might be applications for this method but in most cases in my opinion the state will change on submit.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

With the `value` attribute.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?

Because it's less code and it's easier to read.

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

``` javascript
if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
```

``` javascript
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```
