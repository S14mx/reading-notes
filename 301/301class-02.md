## React lifecycle

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

"Render" happens first

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

Mounting phase

3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
   
Constructor, render, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

4. What does componentDidMount do?

The `componentDidMount()` method allows to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model). This method is called during the Mounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e after the component is rendered.

## React State Vs Props

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?

Props are like arguments to a function, for example you can pass an initial counter, wich is going to be 0 if you are using a counter component. Also you can pass things like title if you want to display that to the user

2. What is the big difference between props and state?

State is handled inside of the component and props are handled outside of the component.

3. When do we re-render our application?

When we change the state inside of our app.

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

Some information that might need to be updated by the user or otherwise. For example if we have a form component with input fields.
