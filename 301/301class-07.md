## How I explained REST to my brother

*Who is Roy Fielding?*

Roy Fielding is the person who helped write the first HTTP protocol, he also did a lot of research on why the web works the way it does.

*Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?*

Because they weren't designed to be used that way, the primary concern was to be able to talk to any machine in the world and not all the machines.

*What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?*

HTTP is a web protocol for sending requests and receiving responses.

*What does a `GET` do?*

It fetches the data on a URL.

*What does a `POST` do?*

It is used when one machine needs to add something to another machine.

*What does `PUT` do?*

It is used when one machine needs to replace something in another machine.

*What does `PATCH` do?*

It is used when one machine needs to partially update something in another machine.
