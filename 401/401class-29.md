# Django Best Practices: Custom User Model

Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication, however, for a real-world project, the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model instead. This provides far more flexibility down the line so, as a general rule, always use a custom user model for all new Django projects.
AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser
There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser. In both cases we can subclass them to extend existing functionality however AbstractBaseUser requires much, much more work. AbstractUser actually subclasses AbstractBaseUser but provides more default configuration.

Update models.py with a new User model which we'll call CustomUser.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    pass
    # add additional fields in here

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
```

Create a new file in the app called forms.py:

```python
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm, UserChangeForm

from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):

    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ("username", "email")

class CustomUserChangeForm(UserChangeForm):

    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ("username", "email")
```

Finally we update admin.py:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin

from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm, CustomUserChangeForm
from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
    add_form = CustomUserCreationForm
    form = CustomUserChangeForm
    model = CustomUser
    list_display = ["email", "username",]

admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)
```
