# Pandas

Pandas is one of the powerful open source libraries in the Python programming language used for data analysis and data manipulation. If you want to work with any tabular data, such as data from a database or any other forms (Like CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.,) then pandas is the best tool.

### To import pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

### Object creation

```python
s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8])
```

### Creating a DataFrame by passing a NumPy array, with a datetime index and labeled columns:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(6, 4), index=dates, columns=list("ABCD"))
```

### Viewing data

```python
df.head()
```

### Getting

Selecting a single column, which yields a Series, equivalent to df.A:

```python
df["A"]
```

Selecting via [], which slices the rows:

```python
df[0:3]
```

### Setting 

Setting a new column automatically aligns the data by the indexes:

```python
s1 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], index=pd.date_range("20130102", periods=6))
```

Setting values by label:

```python
df.at[dates[0], "A"] = 0
```

Setting values by position:

```python
df.iat[0, 1] = 0
```

### Missing data

pandas primarily uses the value np.nan to represent missing data. It is by default not included in computations.

To drop any rows that have missing data:

```python
df1.dropna(how="any")
```

Filling missing data:

```python
df1.fillna(value=5)
```
