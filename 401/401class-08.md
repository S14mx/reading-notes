# List Comprehension

List comprehensions are used for creating new lists from other iterables like tuples, strings, arrays, lists, etc. A list comprehension consists of brackets containing the expression, which is executed for each element along with the for loop to iterate over each element.  

Syntax:

```python
newList = [ expression(element) for element in oldList if condition ] 
```

### *Advantages of List Comprehension*  

- More time-efficient and space-efficient than loops.
- Require fewer lines of code.
- Transforms iterative statement into a formula.

Creating a list with list comprehensions:

```python
digits = [x for x in range(10)]

print(digits)

# output [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Parsing a file using list comprehension:

Itâ€™s also possible to read files in Python using list comprehension.

```python
# open the file in read-only mode
file = open("dreams.txt", 'r')
poem = [ line for line in file ]

for line in poem:
    print(line)

```

Using functions in list comprehensions:

```python
# list comprehension with functions
# create a function that returns a number doubled
def double(x):
    return x*2

nums = [double(x) for x in range(1,10)]
print(nums)

# output [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

```
