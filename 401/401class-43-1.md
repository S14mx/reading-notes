# Microsoft AI Principles

Microsoft's approach to AI is based on responsible principles, such as:

- Accountability
- Transparency
- Reliability & Safety
- Inclusiveness
- Privacy & Security
- Fairness

`"We are operationalizing responsible AI across Microsoft through a central effort led by the Aether Committee, the Office of Responsible AI (ORA) and Responsible AI Strategy in Engineering (RAISE). Together, Aether, ORA, and RAISE work closely with our teams to uphold Microsoftâ€™s responsible AI principles in their day-to-day work."`

There's a public document called [Microsoft Responsible AI Standard, v2](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4ZPmV) where all of the above principles are explained in detail and broken down into goals.
For example, the accountability principal consists of 5 goals: `impact assessment`, `Oversight of significant adverse impacts`, `Fit for purpose`, `Data governance and management` and `Human oversight and control`. Each respective goal has a list of requirements. From reading through the document I can tell that Microsoft takes AI very responsibly and very seriously. They seem to have very solid approach and are continuously revising and improving it, which is exactly what I think how it should be.
