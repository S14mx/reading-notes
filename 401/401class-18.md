## What is Caesar cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

`Example` (alphabet is shifted by 23 positions)

## Decrypting a message

With `Frequency analysis`:

Human languages tend to use some letters more than others. For example, "E" is the most popular letter in the English language. We can analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely "E" and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that.

With `Known plaintext`:

Another term for the original unencrypted message is plaintext. If the enemy already knew some part of the plaintext, it will be easier for them to crack the rest of the encrypted version.

With `Brute force`:

There are only 25 possible shifts (not 26 â€” why not?). We could take some time to try out each of them and find one that yielded a sensible message. We wouldn't even need to try the shifts on the entire message, just the first word or two.
