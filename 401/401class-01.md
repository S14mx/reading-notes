## Pain and Suffering

First part of this reading assignment was an article about pain vs suffering. In my opinion, the goal of this article was to prepare us for the hardships that are coming in this class because it's very important to start this class with the right mindset. My key takaway was that pain is temporary and it should have a purpose and pain without purpose or end goal is just suffering.

## Beginners Guide to Big O

Another part of this assignment was an article and a podcast about Big O notation which is basically a way to evaluate how efficient an algorithm is in terms of speed and memory usage. This topic is pretty complex. It made me realize that it's not only important to find a solution to a problem(which sometimes is hard as it is) but that solution needs to be as efficient as possible. I can already tell that the concepts that we will be learning in this class are already harder than the ones we learned in 301.
