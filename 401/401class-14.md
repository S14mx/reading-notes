# What is `Matplotlib`

Matplotlib is a visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.

One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows us visual access to huge amounts of data in easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.

Matplotlib comes with a set of default settings that allow customizing all kinds of properties. You can control the defaults of almost every property in matplotlib: figure size and dpi, line width, color and style, axes, axis and grid properties, text and font properties and so on. While matplotlib defaults are rather good in most cases, you may want to modify some properties for specific cases.

Simple plot code:

```python
X = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 256, endpoint=True)
C, S = np.cos(X), np.sin(X)
```

Changing colors:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6), dpi=80)
plt.plot(X, C, color="blue", linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-")
plt.plot(X, S, color="red",  linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-")
```

## Code documentation

```python
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> help(plt)
Help on function plot in module matplotlib.pyplot:

plot(*args, **kwargs)
   Plot lines and/or markers to the
   :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`.  *args* is a variable length
   argument, allowing for multiple *x*, *y* pairs with an
   optional format string.  For example, each of the following is
   legal::

       plot(x, y)         # plot x and y using default line style and color
       plot(x, y, 'bo')   # plot x and y using blue circle markers
       plot(y)            # plot y using x as index array 0..N-1
       plot(y, 'r+')      # ditto, but with red plusses

   If *x* and/or *y* is 2-dimensional, then the corresponding columns
   will be plotted.
   ```
