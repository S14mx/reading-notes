## Body, Head and Title elements in HTML

### `<body>` Element

You might have seen `<body>` element before. Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.

### `<head>` Element

Before the `<body>` element you will often see a `<head>` element. This contains information _about_ the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window). You will usually find a `<title>` element inside the `<head>` element.
Anything written between the `<title>`tags will appear in the title bar (or tabs) at the top of the browser window.

### `<title>` Element

The contents of the `<title>` element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is the Title of the Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>
        <p>Anything within the body of a web page is displayed in the main browser window.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
